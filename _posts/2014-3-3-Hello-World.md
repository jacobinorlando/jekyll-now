I introduce you to my website, a collection of projects and memories created by myself. While this blog itself is the first project, it will be followed by many others. The first objective is a gallery of adventures in New Orleans with Jarrett and Arabel. From there, I will be working on templates for small business sites, to eventually sell in local Orlando. Other small personal projects will abound, I'm sure, and graphic design will be a heavy focus. Until I see you next time!
